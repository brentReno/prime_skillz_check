# Prime Skills Check-In

Fork this repo, clone it to your computer, and then complete all of the exercises
split into 8 modules. Put your answers inline after each question.

This is an opportunity to confirm what you know and pinpoint areas you might
need to work on. So, take your time and use any resources you want to explore and
complete each module. Some questions may have new content, use your research skills
to do your best to answer these.

Once you have completed all the questions commit the changes to the files and submit your answers with the github repo link for your fork to the assignment application.
